🔍 Key Findings
- Equity and Mutual Funds emerged as the most balanced and beneficial assets, delivering consistently high ROI with moderate risk, especially over long holding periods.
- Crypto showed the highest returns, but with very high volatility and risk, making it suitable only for risk-tolerant investors.
- Bonds provided the lowest risk and volatility, but also generated the lowest returns, making them ideal for capital preservation rather than growth.
- Real Estate performed strongly in long-term investments, particularly during stable and bull market conditions.
- Gold acted as a defensive asset, offering stable returns during market uncertainty
